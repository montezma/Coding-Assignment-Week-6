/*For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR. You do not need to accept any user input, when you run your code, the entire game should play out instantly without any user input. 
There are many versions of the game WAR, but in this version there are only 2 players and you don’t need to do anything special when there is a tie on a round. 
Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. Consider classes such as Card, Deck, and Player and what fields and methods they might each have. You can implement the game however you’d like (i.e. printing to the console, using alert, or some other way). The completed project should, when run, do the following:
-	Deal 26 Cards to two Players from a Deck. 
-	Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card
-	The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
o	Ties result in zero points for both Players
-	After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.
*/



Run using WarIndex.html

Check the console for the winner. 

Ties will stack due to repeated text but you will see a number letting you know the numebr of ties that happened meaning less points per a tie.
